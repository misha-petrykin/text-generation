The history of New Balance begins in 1906 in the USA in the city of Belmont, where 33-year-old emigrant from England William Riley establishes a laboratory for the development and production of corrective devices. Soon he is developing a special arch support, creating support for the heel of the foot at three points. This technology brings him recognition, and the company gets its first official name - New Balance Arch Company.
In 1938, Riley designs and launches the first New Balance running shoes for a local sports club. In 1940, for the first time, they took part in competitions in it, after which the company began to produce custom-made shoes for athletes involved in not only running, but also baseball, basketball, tennis and boxing.
In 1954, Paul Kidd acquired the company and, together with his wife Eleanor, continued to develop the business. Demand for New Balance products begins to grow rapidly, and custom-made sports shoes are becoming the company's main business, so Paul Kidd gives the company its current name - New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.
In 1972, on the day of the Boston marathon, the company was acquired by Jim Davis. At this time, the company consists of 6 people making 30 pairs of running shoes “Tracker” on a day. From 1992 to 1999, New Balance is the most dynamically developing company on the fast-growing market with the highest and stable annual high-sales, which makes it the largest selling company in the world by that time.
To this day, New Balance manages to remain true to its ideals laid down a century ago by William Riley - to be a constant innovator in the field of sports technology, giving priority to quality over the number of shoes produced.
